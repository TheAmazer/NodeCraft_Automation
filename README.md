## Highlights
- **New!** Immersive landing page with CRT-style transition and animated background.
- **Stormworks-inspired UI:** Industrial aesthetic with a playful Minecraft-themed logo.
- Intuitive drag-and-drop editor with an infinite canvas.
- Real-time simulation with animated flowing wires to show active signals.
- Mixed-signal support: Boolean signals (red) and numerical signals (green).
- Built with plain modern JavaScript — no build step required.

## Quick demo
Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to try the app locally — no installation required.

---

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - No server, no build tools — just static files.
3. Start building on the canvas.

---

## How to use

### Add components
- Press `TAB` to open the animated full-screen component menu.
- Use the Quick Access Bar (keys `1`–`0`) for frequently used components.
- Drag components from the menu onto the canvas.

### Move & select
- Drag node headers to reposition a node.
- Click-and-drag a selection box to select and move multiple nodes.

### Connect & edit wires
- Click and drag from an Output pin (right side) to an Input pin (left side).
- Dragging a connection between already-connected pins will toggle (delete) the connection.

### Configure gates
- Double-click a node or click the gear icon to open the Sidebar editor.
- Edit parameters such as min/max values, custom formulas, and memory reset values.

---

## File format & persistence
- Save your design to a `.logic` file using the Save function.
- Load `.logic` files back into the app with the Load function to continue editing.

---

## Keyboard shortcuts
- TAB — Open component menu
- 1–0 — Quick access bar slots
- Ctrl/Cmd + Z — Undo
- Ctrl/Cmd + Y / Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + Z — Redo
- Delete / Backspace — Remove selected components or wires
- Double-click node — Open configuration sidebar

(Keyboard bindings are customizable in later versions.)

---

## Tutorial & learning
On first run the app launches an interactive tutorial that walks you through:
- menu navigation
- placing components
- wiring signals
- running a simple example circuit

Complete the tutorial to get comfortable with the editor and tools.

---

## Future plans
- Desktop builds using Electron or Tauri for single-click launch.
- Expanded component library: more memory primitives, composite signal types, and utility modules.
- Community-contributed gates and example designs.

---

## Contributing
Contributions, issues and suggestions are welcome!
- Open an issue to discuss a change or feature.
- Fork the repo, create a branch for a feature/fix, and submit a PR.

Please include screenshots or GIFs for visual changes and a short description of behavior for bug fixes.
